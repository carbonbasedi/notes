					Computer science basics
computer understands us through it's CPU(central processing unit) where we send different kinds of information using our input modules ( for example keyboard ) and it takes input from us and analyzes and gives back answer based upon our given parameters( settings or parameters we want it to return us an answer )

we send information using our physical input systems and it goes down into CPU after passing several different phases and turning into binary code also known as Machine code.

Binary or machine code consists of 1s and 0s and which can be arranged into groups of 8 namely bytes.
8 bits = 1 byte 
using this knowledge we can create system which can understand our inputs 

for example letters in our keyboards are encoded using ACSII system. ASCII system consists of 256 elements starting from 0 to 255 each can be represented in binary. Which when sent to CPU ti will give back answer with it's corresponding


						1.INTRODUCTION					

					  1.1 Working with CMD(Command line) 

CMD is for working with system through using shell manager.
There is lots of different versions of shell scripting tools such as
 
bash-ios,linux
zsh-linux
powershell-ms

some commands for bash(my preferred shell :

pwd - print working directory
mkdir - create folder in directory
rmdir - remove folder in directory
cd - change directory
cd .. - go one folder back 
cd ../.. - go two folders back
shutdown now - turns off the machine
mv - to move files or folders from one place to another or rename them
[TAB] key - to autofill

					1.2 Working with GIT / Git Bash / GitHub

Git is a command line tool  - (like shell)
GitHub is a graphical user interface (a website)

Git can be installed on a local machine 
GitHub is hosted on the web and it is exclusively cloud-based 

With Git we can manage our source code history 
with GitHub we can store our codes in a remote repository using Git 

There is three phases process of uploading files to a repository 

phase 1 - Local

in phase one we have our files created and ready for uploading(pushing)
first we initialize git configuration files in working directory so we can start the process of uploading(pushing)

phase 2 - Stage 
after initialization we can move our files from local to stage with [git add " "] command and commiting them to this stage by [git commit -m " "] where we can check the status of our files if they are commited or just added with [git status] command 

phase 3 - Remote

commands for using Git Bash 

git init  -  initializes .git folder in a working directory, where all the configuration files are located for making connection between a local machine and a repository

git add [insert file name here] or [.(dot) for all files] to 






							2.C#
				2.1  C language family and C like languages
C# is one of the popular members of C language family along with C itself and C++

C# is mainly oriented around OOP( object oriented programming ) but it can also be used with other programming paradigms 

C# is CASE SENSITIVE , COMPILED  programming language.
