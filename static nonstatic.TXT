readonly = [access type] [data type] [name of type] {get ;}

static and non static.



all the members of class(methods, fields and properties ) and class itself can be static (can also be applide to a constructor)

when any member of class is made static then it is saved in RAM 

we can use static member in nonstatic member 
but we can't use non static member in static member


static ctor (constructor only works once when class is used first time )


static class does not partake in inheritence(oop)

there is no overload of static constructors 

if you wanna write an extension class and method must be static
